          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer,
          or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may
          seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change
          happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal
          data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
          <br />
          <br />
          We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
          data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our
          third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own
          purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for
          specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
          <br />
          <br />
          International transfers:
          <br />
          <br />
          We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group
          companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data.
          These rules are called &ldquo;binding corporate rules&rdquo;. For
          further details, see European Commission: Binding corporate rules.
          <br />
          <br />
          Many of our external third parties are based outside the European
          Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will
          involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
          similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
          one of the following safeguards is implemented:
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; We will only transfer your personal data to countries
          that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
          personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see
          European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in
          non-EU countries.
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Where we use certain service providers, we may use
          specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
          personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further
          details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of
          personal data to third countries. &nbsp;
          <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer
          data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires
          them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the
          Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US
          Privacy Shield.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
          mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the
          EEA.
          <br />
          <br />
          Data security:
          <br />
          <br />
          We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
          personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
          unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
          to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
          other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
          process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to
          a duty of confidentiality.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
          data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
          breach where we are legally required to do so
          <br />
          <br />
          Data retention:
          <br />
          <br />
          How long will you use my personal data for?
          <br />
          <br />
          We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
          fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
          satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
          <br />
          <br />
          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
          consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
          potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
          personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data
          and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
          applicable legal requirements.
          <br />
          <br />
          Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal
          data are available in our retention policy which you can request from
          us by contacting us.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your legal rights:
          <br />
          <br />
          Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection
          laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:
          <br />
          <br />
          Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a &ldquo;data
          subject access request&rdquo;). This enables you to receive a copy of
          the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
          processing it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This
          enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about
          you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
          data you provide to us.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
          delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
          continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete
          or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
          your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have
          processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
          erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that
          we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for
          specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
          at the time of your request.
          <br />
          <br />
          Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a
          legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
          about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
          rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are
          processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
          cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds
          to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables
          you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the
          following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&rsquo;s
          accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not
          want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we
          no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
          legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we
          need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use
          it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
          We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
          personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
          Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
          initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the
          information to perform a contract with you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
          process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
          lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
          consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
          certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the
          case at the time you withdraw your consent.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please
          contact us.
          <br />
          <br />
          No fee usually required:
          <br />
          <br />
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
          exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
          fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
          Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
          circumstances.
          <br />
          <br />
          What we may need from you
          <br />
          <br />
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
          data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.
          <br />
          <br />
          Time limit to respond:
          <br />
          <br />
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
          Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
          particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
          case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

          Glossary:
          <br />
          <br />
          LAWFUL BASIS
          <br />
          <br />
          Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting
          and managing our business to enable us to give you the best
          service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure
          we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and
          negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our
          legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
          where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we
          have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
          You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate
          interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific
          activities by contacting us
          <br />
          <br />
          Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is
          necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party
          or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
          <br />
          <br />
          Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your
          personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or
          regulatory obligation that we are subject to.
